# MirrorHunt
Horror genre game developed for University of Washington Bothell (UWB) Fall Game Jam 2020.

You are given a mission to execute all the monster from the underworld. A demon had escape from the underworld and hide himself inside a mirror room from a abandon circus. Unfortunately, you come unprepared with only 6 bullet in your pistol. More unfortunately, your car broke down, so you need to stay at the circus for a night.



*If you ask why you have the mission, don't ask me, idk why*

*If you also want to ask why you are so unfortunate, because I need a way to bring you stuck in that circus to fight the demon*
